Rearrangement of GEMS3 svn repository (23.Apr.2010)

r413: 
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K  (development variant)
was merged into r414:
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/trunk/GEMIPM2K  (official variant)

r1589:
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/trunk/gems3 
was merged into r1590:
svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3

From now on, development should be performed in worked copies connected to 
GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K
and
GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3

After testing, the accepted revision (for release) will be simultaneously merged from 
GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K  into GEMIPM2K/trunk/GEMIPM2K
and 
GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3 into GEMS-PSI/trunk/gems3

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 1: checkout of svn HEAD repository modules (starting from revisions 1590 and 414)

GEMIPM2K program URLs: 

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/trunk/GEMIPM2K  (official variant)

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K  (development variant)

Checkout it (either from "trunk" or from "upgrade" URL) into ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K

You should get ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K\*.* where *.* are source code files or test 
data subdirectories. 


GEMS3 GUI Shell + Database Maintenance URLs:

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/trunk/gems3 (official variant)

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3 (official variant)

Checkout it into ...\<work>\gems3

You should get ...\<work>\gems3\*.* where *.* are make files or source code subdirectories
such as mods\, kernel\, ... 


Step 2: Building standalone GEMIPM2K program (the list of files did not change): 

as usual before, go into ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K and 

make -f <Makefile_for_your_platform> 

Those who have Qt4 installed, can produce actual Makefiles by executing in the same directory:

qmake GEMIPM2K.pro

This will produce two makefiles: Makefile.Debug and Makefile.Release. Run for example  

make -f Makefile.Release

Executable file and object files will be created in ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K\Release\

 
Step 3: Building GEMS3:

If you have a gems_qt.pro.user file, copy it from your old gems3 directory into a newly 
checked-out one. Start Qt-Creator and open project gems_qt.pro in the new gems3 directory.

Build GEMS3 as usual (debug or release variants)

Essential requirement: the \gems3 and \standalone\GEMIPM2K working copy directories must be 
in the same directory \<work>  (where <work> can be any directory name)

  
Step 4: to build GEMS3 with the development GEMIPM2K variant instead of the official one:

rename ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K into e.g.  ...\<work>\standalone-trunk\GEMIPM2K

Checkout GEMIPM2K from (see details in Step 1) URL: 

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMIPM2K/upgrade/GEMIPM2K
 
into   ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K

rename ...\<work>\gems3 into e.g.  ...\<work>\gems3-trunk

Checkout GEMS3 from (see details in Step 2) URL: 

svn+ssh://gems@les-svn.psi.ch/srv/svn/repos/GEMS-PSI/upgrade/gems3
 
into   ...\<work>\gems3

Run qmake gems_qt.pro

Run make

Or better start QtCreator and re-build project gems_qt.pro

--------------------------------------------------------------

Working copies  ...\<work>\standalone\GEMIPM2K and ...\<work>\gems3 can be 
changed any time from 'upgrade' to 'trunk' variants or back by executing the 
'switch' SVN command on each directory. In this case, there is no need to 
rename subdirectories as described in Step 4. It is important that this 'switch' 
was applied to both working copies.
