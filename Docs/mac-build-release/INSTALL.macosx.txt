To install GEMS3.9.x on Mac OS X 10.13 and up:

1. Click on the installer dmg file to mount it. A window appears showing the application gems3.app.

2a. (New route): in your home folder, create a subfolder "GEMS" (this can be done in Finder using the "Go" "Home" menu, or in terminal using commands "cd ~" and then "mkdir GEMS"). Drag gems3.app from the window of the opened dmg installer into the subfolder "GEMS" in your home folder.

2b. (Old route): Drag gems3.app from the window of the opened dmg installer to the /Applications folder. Alternative: drag gems3.app to the "Applications" subfolder in your home folder.

3. The gems3.app contains program and resource files, including help database and /DB.default folder with the thermodynamic database. To access gems3.app resources in Finder, right-click on gems3.app and choose "Show package contents", then click on Contents and then on Resources.

4. Close the dmg installer window and start GEM-Selektor by clicking on "gems3.app" in one of the above locations where you put it before. In case of the first installation of GEM-Selektor, this will create (in your home folder) a subfolder ~/Library/Gems3/projects, where some test modelling projects will be copied, and your own modelling projects will be stored later on. If such folder exists then GEM-Selektor should immediately start (i.e. test projects will not be overwritten).

5. To add your old projects folders into ~/Library/gems3/projects/: shut down GEM-Selektor app, copy the project folders from your backup locations, and start gems3.app again. A regular backup of your modelling projects is recommended (once per a few days).

6. To add the GEMS3.9.x icon to Dock, launch gems3.app, right-click on a GEMS3 icon in the Dock, and select "Keep in Dock".

7. To update GEM-Selektor: just move gems3.app from where you installed it to Trash, and proceed with step 1 through 4. Only files in gems3.app will be replaced; your own modelling projects, located in the ~/Library/gems3/projects/ folder, will not be affected. To locate this folder in Finder on older versions of MacOS, click on Mac OSX desktop, "Go" "Go to folder...", type "~/Library" in the appearing dialog, and click on the "Go" button.

8. The incremental online installer based on Qt Installer Framework is in the works to appear soon in https://gems.web.psi.ch . To use it instead of the simple installer, follow instructions there.
