HOW TO PRODUCE AN INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF Qt5-based GEMS3 FOR LINUX

(replaces Produce-linux.txt)

This deployment process is based on the "gemsdeployqtapp.sh" script,
which is an augmented and extended "deployqtapp.sh" script from
https://github.com/goblincoding/qtscripts by goblincoding, see also
http://goblincoding.com/2013/11/07/deploying-qt-5-applications-on-ubuntu-12-04/  

1. Make sure that Qt5 SDK is installed with source code as /Qt in 
your home directory; we assume that the Qt library is located as 
"/home/<you>/Qt/5.12.0/src" and "/home/<you>/Qt/5.12.0/gcc_64".
If not yet done, copy recursively the "/Docs/build-release" directory from the 
folder where this file is located to the folder in which the "/gems3gui" folder
is located. Typically, you should have "~/gitGEMS/gems3gui";
"~/gitGEMS/standalone"; and "~/gitGEMS/build-release" folders at the same level.

2. Copy/refresh the folder Resources from "~/gitGEMS/gems3gui/Resources" to 
"~/gitGEMS/build-release/Resources".

3. Make sure that you have built (with the QtCreator) a release variant 
of GEM-Selektor v.3.4.4 in "/home/<you>/gitGEMS3/build-release", where
an executable script "gemsdeployqtapp.sh" and several other files are located; 
if the script is not executable, open a terminal, cd to that directory, and run 
   $ chmod u+x ./gemsdeployqtapp.sh.
Edit this script to make sure that path to Qt locations are correct everywhere
and that the "distro" string definition contains correct verison and release 
numbers of GEM-Selektor.

4. Open a Linux terminal, cd to "/home/<you>/gitGEMS3/build-release",
and execute the script "gemsdeployqtapp.sh" giving the exec file name as shown:
   $ ./gemsdeployqtapp.sh gems3

This will create an archive "Gems3.4.4-<rev1>.<rev2>-linux-x86-64.tgz", where
<rev1> and <rev2> stay for revision numbers of GEM-Selektor GUI and GEMS3K, 
respectively, that you have entered before into the gemsdeployqtapp.sh script.
For instance, "Gems3.4.4-0c19d8d.4abd759-linux-x86-64.tgz". The distribution
archive can now be provided for download.

Optionally, to investigate the script output, run
   $ ./gemsdeployqtapp.sh gems3 > ./output.txt

5. For installation steps, see INSTALL-linux.txt. Install and test if it works.
If gems3 does not start, try the following. In terminal, cd to 
"/Gems3-app/platforms" and run there the script "fixdep.sh" with root rights:
   $ sudo ./fixdep.sh

The fixdep.sh script needs superuser because it can automatically download the 
necessary libraries for your platform.
