GEMS3K is the numerical kernel of the GEM-Selektor v.3 package for geochemical modelling.

### Briefly about GEMS3K ###

* Implements the improved GEM IPM-3 algorithm with excellent mass balance precision and fast convergence to Gibbs energy minimum even in very complex non-ideal chemical systems with two-sided metastability constraints (learn more on GEMS3K web page).
* Written in C/C++. Using compiler directives, the GEMS3K code can be compiled as a standalone program e.g. 'gemcalc'; as a static or dynamic library for coupling with the mass transport simulator or another code; or as part of the GEM-Selektor v3 code together with GUI and databases.
* Version: currently 3.3.3.
* Distributed as is (no liability) under the terms of Lesser GPL v.3 license.
