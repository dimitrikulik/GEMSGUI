GEMS3K is the numerical kernel of the GEM-Selektor v.3 package for geochemical modelling.

### Briefly about GEMS3K ###

* Implements the improved GEM IPM-3 algorithm with excellent mass balance precision and fast convergence to Gibbs energy minimum even in very complex non-ideal chemical systems with two-sided metastability constraints (learn more on GEMS3K web page).
* Written in C/C++. Using compiler directives, the GEMS3K code can be compiled as a standalone program e.g. 'gemcalc'; as a static or dynamic library for coupling with the mass transport simulator or another code; or as part of the GEM-Selektor v3 code together with GUI and databases.
* Version: currently 3.3.3.
* Distributed as is (no liability) under the terms of Lesser GPL v.3 license. 

### How to clone (download) GEMS3K source code ###

* In your home directory, make a folder named e.g. ~/gitGEMS3 with a subfolder gitGEMS3/standalone.
* Change into ~/gitGEMS3/standalone and clone this repository from https://bitbucket.org/gems4/gems3k.git using a preinstalled free git client SourceTree or SmartGit (the best way on Windows). 
* Alternatively on Mac OS X or linux, open a terminal and type in the command line (do not forget a period):
~~~
git clone https://bitbucket.org/gems4/gems3k.git . 
~~~
* To switch to another branch (e.g. devEJDB), use a git client or open a terminal, cd to ~/gitGEMS3/standalone, and type in the command line
~~~
git checkout -b branches/devEJDB --track origin/branches/devEJDB
git pull origin branches/devEJDB
~~~
To switch back to trunk, type
~~~
git checkout trunk
~~~
