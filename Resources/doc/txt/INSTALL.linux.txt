To install GEMS3.1 on linux (ubuntu >= 10.4; fedora >= 15; kubuntu >= 10.4; OpenSuSE >=12.0):

1. Copy the installer file into your home directory. 

2. Unpack the installer - this will create a folder ~/Gems3-app that contains program and 
   resource files, including help database and /DB.default folder with thermodynamic database. 

3. Optionally, you can create a folder like ~/MYGEMS and move the folder ~/Gems3-app there. 

4. cd into /Gems3-app and execute ./gems3.bash -d    (or ./gems3.sh -d). 
   The GEMS program should launch; after you exit it, the folder /Library/gems3/projects with 
   several test projects will be available at the same level as the /Gems3-app folder. 

5. You can add your old projects folders into /Library/gems3/projects/. 
   Backup of modeling projects is strongly recommended at list once a day.

6. To create a desktop shortcut for starting GEMS: 
   copy the file GEMSv3.1.desktop from /Gems3-App/ToDesktop to ~/Desktop folder;
   right-click on the GEMSv3.1 icon on your desktop and check the location of the program 
   (/Gems3-app/gems3.bash -c) and the icon (/Gems3-app/gems3.png). and save. 

7. Start GEMS by clicking on the desktop icon.


To update GEMS, unpack the installer archive and replace with it the /Gems3-app folder only
(your projects will remain intact in the /Library/Gems3/projects folder).
