To install GEMS3.1 on Mac OS X Snow Leopard or Lion: 

1. Click on the installer dmg file to mount it. A window appears with the application gems3.app. 

2. Drag gems3.app from that window to the /Applications folder. The gems3.app contains program 
   and resource files, including help database and /DB.default folder with thermodynamic database.   

3. Start GEMS by clicking on gems3.app in /Applications folder. This will create a subfolder 
   ~/Library/Gems3/projects in your user home directory, where modeling projects will be stored. 

4. You can add your old projects folders into /Library/gems3/projects/. Backup of modeling 
   projects is strongly recommended at least once per day. To see this folder in Finder: 
   open the Terminal; cd to your user's directory; and run the command:
      chflags nohidden ~/Library/
   This command will have effect until the next reboot or logout/login. 

5. To add the GEMS3.1 icon to Dock: start GEMS, right-click on its icon in the dock, and select 
   "Keep in Dock". 

To update GEMS: move gems3.app from /Applications to Trash, and proceed with step 1. Only files in 
gems3-app will be replaced; your modeling projects in /Library/gems3/projects/ will not be affected.
