To install GEMS3.1 on Windows XP, Windows 7, or Windows 8:

1. Copy the installer file into a temporary location and execute it.  

2. The installer will ask where to install/update, showing C:\Selektor as a suggestion. 
   If you accept this, the program will be located in C:\Selektor\Gems3-app. This folder 
   contains program and resource files, including help database and /DB.default folder with 
   the thermodynamic database.  
   Upon the first start, a folder C:\Selektor\Library\Gems3\projects will be created, 
   where modeling projects will be stored. 

3. Alternatively, you can type or select another location (\Program Files is not recommended), 
   for example D:\MyWork\Modeling. In this case, the program will be located in 
   D:\MyWork\Modeling\Gems3-app and the projects- in D:\MyWork\Modeling\\Library\Gems3\projects.

3. After extracting files, GEMS will start; you can exit it and look for a GEMS v3.1 icon on 
   your desktop, to be used further on for staring GEMS.  

5. You can add your old projects folders into /Library/gems3/projects/. Backup of modeling 
   projects is strongly recommended at least once per day. 


To update GEMS, start the installer and browse to the location where GEMS is installed, for 
example, to D:\MyWork\Modeling. Only files in the /Gems3-app subfolder will be replaced; your 
modeling projects in /Library/gems3/projects/ will not be changed.
