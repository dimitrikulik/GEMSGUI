<h2>Automatic Setup of Aqueous and Gas/Fluid Phases</h2>


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2> </h2>



<p>This dialog facilitates definition of the aqueous
electrolyte
phase and/or the gas/fluid mixture phase that are automatically
assembled upon opening or creating a GEMS modelling project. 
Alternatively, a Phase record already available in the project database 
can be selected,
 or the aqueous phase (or gas/fluid mixture) can be excluded from the 
template chemical system definition in this modeling project. <br>

</p>


<p>The first tab "Select Aqueous Electrolyte Model" lets you define a
built-in
function for calculating activity coefficients of individual aqueous
species.
These can be selected by clicking on radio buttons on the left-hand side. The two last
choices
should be used when none of the built-in functions is applicable, or no
aqueous
phase should be included into the chemical system definition. In the
"Parameters for the aqueous model"
frame, you can change some default parameters used in some of the
built-in
aqueous activity functions that are described below.<br>

</p>


<p>Most aqueous activity coefficient models that are currently
supported by the GEMS code belong to extended
Debye-H&uuml;ckel (EDH) models (see document <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">"/Resources/doc/pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf"</span> </span>for
details  and references). In these models,
the extended term <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">(<span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span>) </span>can be a function of pressure and
temperature or a constant value. In the drop-down list "b_gamma(P,T) mode",
the operation mode of the<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span> </span>function can be selected. If
the mode<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">"constant"</span> </span>is chosen, the value of<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span> </span>at reference state
conditions (25 <sup style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">o</sup>C, 1 bar) needs to be selected in the
"b_gamma(1,298) value" drop-down list, or another value be entered there.<br>

</p>


<p>Alternatively, for calculations at hydrothermal conditions, the
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span> </span>term can be a function of temperature and pressure. In this
case, one of four built-in<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span>
 </span>functions for different so-called background
electrolytes (NaCl, KCl, NaOH, KOH) can be selected. The concept of the
background electrolyte means an assumption that the aqueous
solution is dominantly composed of that particular
electrolyte, so the model should be chosen accordingly. For instance, if
 in your
project you mainly deal with NaCl-rich fluids (the most common case) or 
with seawater, choose the NaCl variant; for cementitious systems, the 
KOH variant can be chosen. <br>

  </p>


<p>Note that because of
thermodynamic consistency, T-P-dependent<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span>
</span>functions should be used in conjunction with the extended
Debye-H&uuml;ckel model after <a href="#HELGESON_REFS">Helgeson and coworkers</a>, i.e. the second
model in this tab, which has the code "H". If a T-P dependent <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma</span> model </span>is
selected, there is no need to enter a number into the "b_gamma(1,298)
value" field because this value is automatically calculated by a
built-in routine. However, it is still necessary to set the appropriate
value of the ion size parameter <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">a0</span> </span>for each of the four background
electrolytes. The value of <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">a0</span> </span>(also called "distance
of closest approach") is selected from the drop-down list "Common a0 value" (or entered there). The recommended <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">a0</span> </span>values for the four background
electrolytes are:<br>

<p>From the Debye-Hueckel models described above, the activity coefficients
of aqueous electrolyte species (charged ions and complexes) will be
calculated. For uncharged species (neutral ion pairs and complexes,
neutral dissolved gas molecules such as CO2, H2S
etc.) and for water solvent, different activity coefficient model 
options can
be used. Four combinations exist, which can be specified using the 
"Gamma (neutral species)" and "Gamma (water solvent)" drop-down lists. 
In the former, the activity coefficient of any neutral aqueous species 
can be either set to unity or calculated as<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">b_gamma * IS</span>;
</span> in the latter, the activity coefficient of water-solvent can be set to 
unity or computed from the osmotic coefficient by the built-in routine.</p>



<p>Note that the 
basic model should be selected (by clicking the appropriate
radio button on the left side of the tab) before setting up details of 
calculation modes and parameters (T-P-dependence of parameters,
calculation of activity coefficients for neutral species and water
solvent) on the right side of the tab. Because of thermodynamic 
consistency, options that explicitly calculate the activity coefficient 
of
water solvent
should only be used with the extended Debye-H&uuml;ckel model after
  <a href="#HELGESON_REFS">Helgeson and coworkers</a>.</p>



<p>Clicking on the "Check" button displays a record key of the <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase record</a> to be automatically generated; the
chosen model and its parameters will be identified in the <a style="font-family: Calibri;" href="gm_phase.html#PhName">PhName</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span>and<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><a style="font-family: Calibri;" href="gm_phase.html#PhNote">PhNote</a><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span>fields of the record key. You can
check
them later when you open the "Phase" page of the "System" window from
the
"Single Thermodynamic System" dialog, mark the aqueous phase record key, and
press
F7 keyboard key. Note that, before the same modelling project is
opened
next time, this Phase definition record will be automatically deleted
and
generated again without displaying this setup dialog.</p>


<p>The second tab "Select Gas/Fluid Mixture Model" defines the
automatically
generated Phase record for the gas or fluid mixture. It functions in a way
similar
to that for the aqueous phase. The generic models that are currently
supported are (1) an ideal gas mixture (I); (2) non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Churakov-Gottschalk (CG) model (F); (3) non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Peng-Robinson (PR) model (7);&nbsp; (4) non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Peng-Robinson-Stryjek-Vera (PRSV) model (P); and (5) (3) non-ideal gas (fluid)
mixture calculated with the Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) model (E). See document<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> <span style="font-family: Calibri;">"/Resources/doc/pdf/Activity-Coeffs.pdf"</span> </span>for
details  and references. Other
 automatic models can be added in future versions. The use of the 
automatically-generated definition of gas/fluid mixture implies that 
consistent parameters are provided in DComp records available in the 
project database. Note that no additional options for
the gas/fluid
mixture (right-hand side of the wizard tab) are used in this version of
GEM-Selektor.</p>



<p>Any "specific interaction" non-ideal model of aqueous electrolyte or gas (fluid)
mixture cannot be composed in the automatic mode and must be first created in
GEMS Database Mode as a specific <a href="gm_phase.html">Phase definition record</a>. Such a definition typically contains a list of included chemical species, and an array of
interaction parameter coefficients entered into the <a href="gm_phase.html#ph_cf">ph_cf</a>
 table. Such Phase
record can then be selected in this wizard by choosing the option "Do 
not
generate; select a user-defined Phase record from database, U" present 
on both tabs. After
selecting this option, a list of suitable Phase records will be 
displayed, from which one record must be selected. Note that, If there 
is only one suitable record available in the project database, the list 
will not appear and this record will be taken automatically. By clicking
 "Check" button, you can see which record has been chosen in the "Phase 
record key" field.&nbsp; <br>
</p>


<p>The setup of automatically generated or selected Phase records for aqueous and
gas
phases can be changed any time upon opening the modelling project. To
change, deactivate the "Retain setup of aqueous (and gas) phases" option in
the <a href="gm_project.html#HOWTO">"Modelling Projects" dialog</a> before
selecting an existing project to be opened.&nbsp;</p>
