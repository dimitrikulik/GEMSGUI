<h2><a name="ELEMENTS_INTRO"></a>1. Introduction to Elements
Selection Dialog </h2>

<p>The &nbsp;Elements Dialog appears when an independent modelling
project (<a href="gm_project.html">more...</a>) is created or extended. 
This dialog should facilitate
collection of necessary data from GEMS default database and copying
it&nbsp; into the user's project database, when and where appropriate.
The main basis for
the data selection is the system stoichiometry basis, i.e. the list of 
chemical elements (and additional Independent Components, <a href="gm_icomp.html">more...</a>).&nbsp;</p>


<p>The Elements Dialog resembles a Periodic Table composed of
buttons with
chemical element symbols. The program automatically checks all IComp
records
accessible when opening of the dialog, and makes the
buttons
of all available elements clickable with their symbols dark. The same
happens
with additional Independent Components, which (if present) will be
shown
on buttons in the "Other" column on the right side.</p>


<p>Before clicking on the elements buttons to select them into the
stoichiometry basis of the project system, it may be necessary to
change some of the options visible at the bottom of the
Elements Dialog (shown below): <br>
</p>
<p><img style=" width: 585px; height: 85px;" alt="ElementsDialog-Options.png" src="ElementsDialog-Options.png"><br>
</p>


<p>The "Set Filters" button opens up a separate Set Filters Dialog (<a href="#FILTERS">more...</a>).&nbsp; The "Learn more" button opens this help page.<br>
</p>
<p>To the right of "Set Filters" button, checkboxes in the
upper
row called "Phases-&gt;" configure, which types of phases will be taken
into
the project system (i.e. which Phase records will be copied into the project database from the GEMS default database):</p>

<p>If some phases (e.g. pure solids) are not needed in the
project,
they can be easily removed later (in "Thermodynamic Database" mode).

version of the default database (or in Specific parts), in which case 
activating respective options will have no effect. <br>
</p>

<p>A&nbsp;"data selection" row of checkboxes (called "Dataset:") defines
 in which "layers" of the default database the program should look for 
the
available
data to build this modeling project. These "layers" are identified by 
keywords in default database file names (located in the Gems3 
application "/Resources/DB.default" folder).<br>

<p>This is a simple but efficient way of maintaining a "layered"
structure of the default thermodynamic database. Contents of the
respective database layers are described in the <a href="gems_ctdb.html">default database documentation</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>Note that only one Specific database file set can be present in one 
"/Resources/DB.default" folder (i.e. not both Cemdata and Heracles 
databases). The reason is that some of these databases are built on top 
of the Kernel (Cemdata) or Complem database, while other are completely 
independent of Kernel or Complem layers. If you need to use this or that
 Specific database on the same PC, the safest way is to install GEMS in 
two different places and then add one Specific database per 
"/Resources/DB.default" directory. The /projects subdirectories must 
also have different locations (these can be set as command-line 
parameters for one of Gems3 executable files). &nbsp; &nbsp;

<h2><a name="ELEMENTS_PROJ_SETUP"></a>2. Setting up the
Project Stoichiometry Basis using Elements Dialog<br>
</h2>

<p>(1). We recommend to begin with a list of chemical elements (and 
optional additional Independent Components) that cover the compositions 
to be considered in the prospective applications of the newly-created 
modeling project. Also, consult the the <a href="gems_ctdb.html">default database documentation</a>
 for pressure and temperature ranges, and decide which database layer to
 use (e.g. Kernel for low-temperature waste-repository systems, or 
Complem for hydrothermal systems). If Specific database is needed, check
 that its files are already copied into the currently used 
"/Resources/DB.default" folder (you can check its location in the <a href="gems_setup.html#PREFERENCES_DIALOG">Preferences Dialog</a>); if necessary, exit GEMS, copy the Specific files over, start GEMS and proceed. <br>
</p>
<p>(2). Make necessary selections of "Dataset:" and "Phases" types. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Important!</span> After any of checkboxes in the "Data:" group were changed, or the "Set
Filters" dialog was accessed, the selection of buttons for chemical
elements and additional IC will be reset. For this reason, first (if
necessary) change the filtering settings, and only then select Independent
Components to be taken into the project system basis (see the next step).<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"> </span><font face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif"><br>
  </font></p>
<p>(3) After that, click on "active" (not gray) buttons representing 
elements or, on the right-hand side, "Other" (additional) Independent 
Components. If aqueous systems will be modeled, make sure that H, O and 
e(Zz) buttons are selected. For using "atmospheric air" compositions 
(with non-reactive nitrogen gas), select "Nit" (in "Others"; it is 
possible to select it when N (reactive nitrogen) is selected). When 
done, click "Ok" to proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(4). In the appearing "Setup of aqueous and gas phases" wizard, 
select desired automatic or specific models for aqueous electrolyte and 
gas/fluid mixture (<a href="gems_aphsetup.html">more...</a>), and click "Ok" to proceed. This should bring you into "Equilibria Calculation" mode where you can create the first SysEq record key and proceed <a href="gm_project.html#HOWTO_1ST_SYSTEM">as decribed here</a>. 
Note that even if you press "Cancel" at this step and will exit without 
defining the first system and calculating equilibrium state, you can do 
it any time later when you start GEMS again and simply open this 
newly-created project. <br>
</p>


<p style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
</p>

<p>If any error message appears before you see the SysEq record key 
dialog to create the first system, exit GEMS and check for the subfolder
 with this (failed) project name in the active "/projects" folder (you 
can check its location in the <a href="gems_setup.html#PREFERENCES_DIALOG">Preferences Dialog</a>).
 If you find it there, delete the subfolder, start GEMS and try again. 
The most frequent reason for such a failure is that different versions 
of default database or more than one Specific database are mixed in the 
active "/Resources/DB.default" folder. </p>
<br>


<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="FILTERS"></a>3. Advanced Configuration: Set Filters Dialog<br>
</h2>

<p>Advanced users can use this dialog for "fine-grained" control on 
choosing default database files as source of data records for the 
newly-created or extended modeling project, and setting rules for 
re-naming database records by copying them into project database. This renaming is necessary because in GEMS database, two records with
 the same key are not allowed to exist. Re-naming always occurs in the 
last field of the record key (record key formats are described <a href="gems_rekey.html">here...</a>).<br>


</p>
<p>In future versions of GEM-Selektor, optional filter scripts are 
foreseen in this dialog that would make even more control possible on 
selecting DComp, ReacDC and Compos records to be taken into the modeling
 project. <br>
</p>
<h3>Database Files Tab<br>
</h3>
<p>This tab shows a tree-like view of the files available in DB.default 
database chains. Highlighted are files that will be used for selecting 
records to be copied into modeling project according to "Phases" and 
"Dataset" options in the Elements Dialog (<a href="#ELEMENTS_INTRO">more...</a>).&nbsp;
 The selection can be changed by clicking on file name rows in each 
chain. In principle, this option even allows having more than one 
"specific" database file set in the "/Resources/DB.default" folder because the proper files can be selected here. &nbsp; </p>
<h3>IComp Tab<br>
</h3>
<p>This tab shows two lists of IComp records: one for currently selected
 in the Elements Dialog, and another (only for project made by extension
 of an existing project) showing Independent Components in the "parent" 
existing project. Taken together, these lists form the major filter for 
all Compos, DComp and ReacDC records in the accessible part of the 
default database. Any record whose formula contains at least one 
Independent Component not in this filter will be discarded and not taken
 over into the modeling project.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>In the upper part of this tab, there are two drop-down lists that can
 be used to control how IComp records will be renamed by copying them 
from default to project database. The upper selection defines what 
character(s) to locate in the last field of the record key, and the 
lower selection defines the replacement character(s). Templates are described here... .
 By default, copying of an IComp record to project database adds 
underscore '_' after the last non-space character of the third field of 
IComp record key, for example "Iron" -&gt; "Iron_".&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h3>Compos Tab<br>
</h3>
<p>In the upper part, this tab contains two drop-down lists that can be 
used to control how Compos records will be renamed by copying them from 
default to project database. The upper selection defines what 
character(s) to locate in the last field of the record key, and the 
lower selection defines the replacement character(s). Templates are described here... .
 By default, copying of a Compos record to project database adds 
underscore '_' after the last non-space character of the last field of Compos record key.&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<p>By default, any Compos record whose stoichiometry contains at least 
one Independent Component not from the list selected in the Elements 
Dialog for this project, will be discarded, and its record key added to 
the "DiscardedRecords.txt" file (<a href="#DISCARDED_PHASES">more...</a>).<br>
</p>
<h3>DComp Tab<br>
</h3>

<p>In the upper part, this tab contains two drop-down lists that can be 
used to control how DComp records will be renamed by copying them from 
default to project database. The upper selection defines what 
character(s) to locate in the last field of the record key, and the 
lower selection defines the replacement character(s). Templates are described here... .
 By default, copying of a DComp record to project database replaces the last non-space character with the 
underscore '_' in the fourth record key field, for example "s98" -&gt; "s9_".&nbsp; <br>
</p>
<h3>ReacDC Tab<br>
</h3>

<p>In the upper part, this tab contains two drop-down lists that can be 
used to control how ReacDC records will be renamed by copying them from 
default to project database. The upper selection defines what 
character(s) to locate in the last field of the record key, and the 
lower selection defines the replacement character(s). Templates are described here... .
 By default, copying of a ReacDC record to project database replaces the last non-space character with the 
underscore '_' in the fourth record key field.&nbsp; </p>
<h3>Phases Tab<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span></p>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"></span>
<p>In the upper part, this tab contains two drop-down lists that can be 
used to control how Phase records will be renamed by copying them from 
default to project database. The upper selection defines what 
character(s) to locate in the last field of the record key, and the 
lower selection defines the replacement character(s). Templates are described here... .
 By default, copying of a Phase record to project database adds 
underscore '_' after the last non-space character of the last field of Phase record key. </p>
<p>This tab also contains several options in addition to "Phases" options in the Elements Dialog (<a href="#ELEMENTS_INTRO">more...</a>). Text on options is self-explanatory. Options 1, 3, 4, 5 are "On" and 2, 6 "Off" by default. When option 3 is "On", the list of discarded phases will be written in a text file "DiscardedRecords.txt", described below. <br>
</p>
<span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
<br>
</span>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><a name="DISCARDED_PHASES"></a><span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">4. List of Discarded Records</span></span></h2>

<p>During creation (extension) the modeling project, come Compos and 
Phase records may be discarded from copying into the project database, 
although such records can be potentially useful in the modeling 
application context. <br>
</p>
<p>For example, a Compos record may contain a complex rock composition 
expressed in 8 major and 6 minor elements. If a project stoichiometry 
basis does not contain some of those major elements then this rock 
composition will be most probably unusable in the newly-created project.
 However, if all 8 major elements are included in the project basis and 
only some minor elements are not, the rock composition can be perhaps 
easily modified (by removing entries for missing minor components) for 
use in the new project. This cannot be done automatically, so the 
program leaves it for the user's discretion and will not copy the Compos
 record into project database, but add it record key to a section "Discarded Compos records" of the "DiscardedRecords.txt" file. <br>

</p>

<p>If a record for phase-solution has been encountered in the default 
database, and some components (species, end members) in the phase were 
not copied into the modeling project due to a mismatch with the 
stoichiometry basis, such phase definition will normally not be copied into project database, and its record key added to the "Discarded Phase records" of the "DiscardedRecords.txt" file. 
</p>
The "DiscardedRecords.txt" file, if present, can be found in the same 
folder where the GEMS executable file exists (typically, in Gems3-app 
subfolder; in Mac OS, in the "/Applications" folder at the same level 
where gems3.app is located). This file is over-written every time when a
 new project is created or expanded.<br>
<br>
If it is easier to utilize some discarded records than create similar 
ones from scratch, the user can find the "DiscardedRecords.txt" file, 
identify records there, start GEMS, open the project, then close it, 
find the records in the default database, manually copy them into the 
project database, and remake/edit there to make them consistent with the
 project stoichiometry basis.<br>
