Installation procedure for MacOS

-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. make RELEASE=YES
    will create a release version of gems in ./gems2.app/Contents/MacOS

2. copy gems2 package contents into ./gems2.app/Contents/Resources
    it should look like this:
       gems2.app/
	   Contents/
	     Resources/
		DB.default/
		img/
		doc/
		....

3. make zip
    will create the archive 'gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip' on 
    current MacOS user's Desktop  (if there's an existing zip file, 
    it will be renamed to ~/Desktop/gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip.bak)

4. gems2-mac-{current_date}.zip file can be distributed

5. To install on Mac G3, G4 or G5 with MacOS X 10.2 or later, 
   drop the distribution file to user's desktop and double-click 
   on the icon. The file will be unzipped into /Applications/Gems2.app
   bundle.

6. At the first start of gems2, the default project(s) will be 
automatically copied into the user's home directory (see below).

  Default directories on Mac OS X:
    Program:	                ./gems2.app/Contents/Resources
    User's data (projects):	~/Library/gems2
    
NOTE: the application bundle on MacOS desktop should be called 'gems2',
otherwise it will not be able to find the gems program files.

7. To upgrade installed GEMS2 package, first drag the start gems2 
   icon to Trash or using Finder, delete the GEMS2 program bundle
   gems2.app in Applications directory. Then proceed with new
   release zip file of GEMS2, as described under (5). Your user's
   data (modelling projects) in your home directory will remain 
   unchanged.
