HOW TO PRODUCE UPGRADED INSTALLATION PACKAGE OF GEMS_PSI FOR MAC

Needs Tres Thoenen's G4 Mac running 

1. Open a SSH terminal: 

  ssh guest@129.129.204.77   (password: Gems Selektor)

Check QTDIR (if Qt is istalled):

  echo $QTDIR

  cd work/gems2
  setenv CVS_RSH ssh

2. Make update of GEMS source code tree: 

  cvs update <password> 

3. Build the release executable file: 

  make RELEASE=YES

It makes sense to re-read configuration 
files before producing zip package (see below)

4. For further steps, see INSTALL-mac.txt


To run GEMS from virtual desktop (on Linux): 

start KDE virtual desktop client for 
  129.129.204.77:0  <password for user guest>

After getting Mac desktop window, open a 
terminal there and 

  cd work/gems2
  make RELEASE=YES

when done, re-read configuration files: 

  ./gems2 ./rungems.sh -d 

and then exit GEMS.
