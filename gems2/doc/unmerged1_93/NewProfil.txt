Comments to this sequence:

A. Suggest "MyWork:MyData" instead of "*:*:".

B. This has to be removed when the checkbox will be added to 
   SettingsDialog.

C. This question is not necessary if a new profile is
   created. 

D. Automatically copy 1st and 2nd fields of Profile 
   record key into MSname and MSnote, resp. - 
   the user will just press "Ok" in most cases. 

E. From SetFilters dialog, come back to ElementsDialog.

F,G. List of rejected phases must be either printed to 
   file (then it makes no sense to show it), or make
   it possible to select and copy some phases. 

H. As FileConfig dialog will be implemented in a 
   SetFiltersDialog card, here it is not necessary 
   and can be removed.

I. Is this necessary? I think, showing the profile 
   record here can be skipped.    

K. Here, instead of showing "<Profile>:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:", 
   show "<Profile>:G:MySystem:0:0:1:25:0:". The user
   will then maybe correct the system name or can 
   immediately press "Ok".   

L. After calculation of equilibria, it's better to 
   open at once ListView with calculation results.
